# GCB-009 Implementation Diary

## 2026-04-24/25 — Full Session

**Goal:** Implement the git-aware codebase index across 6 phases, keeping a diary and committing at each phase boundary.

**Starting state:** Design doc written (62KB, 13 parts), ticket created, reMarkable upload done. No code yet.

### Phase 1: Foundation — gitutil + history store + scan/list CLI

**Commit:** `33d10c6 Add git-aware codebase history index (Phase 1: gitutil + history store + scan/list CLI)`

#### What was implemented

**`internal/gitutil/`** — Git CLI wrapper:
- `log.go`: `Commit` struct, `LogCommits(rangeSpec)` parses custom `git log --format` output, `ChangedFiles(hash)` via `git diff-tree`, `ResolveRef(ref)` via `git rev-parse`, `IsAncestor(parent, child)` via `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
- `worktree.go`: `CreateWorktree(repoRoot, hash)` → `git worktree add --detach`, `RemoveWorktree()`, `WorktreePool` with semaphore-based slot management for parallel indexing
- `show.go`: `ShowFile(repoRoot, hash, path)` → `git show hash:path`, `FileBlobHash()` via `git rev-parse`

**`internal/history/`** — History database:
- `schema.go`: `commits` table (hash, short_hash, message, author, timestamp, parents, tree_hash, indexed_at, branch, error), `snapshot_packages/files/symbols/refs` tables (all carry `commit_hash` PK dimension), `file_contents` table for body diff cache, `symbol_history` view
- `store.go`: `Open()` with WAL mode, `Create()` with schema reset, `HasCommit()`, `GetCommit()`, `ListCommits()`, `SymbolCountAtCommit()`
- `loader.go`: `LoadSnapshot(commit, idx, worktreeDir)` — bulk-inserts all packages/files/symbols/refs for one commit in a transaction. Computes `body_hash` by reading the file from the worktree and hashing `content[startOffset:endOffset]`
- `scanner.go`: `ScanCommits()` — discovers commits via `gitutil.LogCommits()`, filters by file path prefix, skips already-indexed commits when `--incremental`
- `indexer.go`: `IndexCommits()` — orchestrates per-commit extraction. Two modes: `--worktrees` (creates git worktree per commit, extracts, loads) and direct mode (extracts from working dir — for single-commit testing)

**`cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/history/`** — CLI:
- `root.go`: `history` parent command
- `scan.go`: `history scan --range HEAD~20..HEAD --worktrees --incremental --filter path/`
- `list.go`: `history list --db history.db` with formatted table (hash, date, symbol count, message)

**`cmd/codebase-browser/main.go`**: Added `history.Register(rootCmd)`

#### Tests

- `internal/gitutil/log_test.go`: `TestLogCommits` (3 commits parsed correctly, most recent first), `TestLogCommitsRange` (HEAD~1..HEAD returns 1), `TestChangedFiles` (main.go in list), `TestResolveRef`
- `internal/gitutil/worktree_test.go`: `TestCreateAndRemoveWorktree` (creates worktree, reads file, verifies content matches commit, removes), `TestShowFile` (reads file at specific commit via git show)
- All use a temp git repo with 3 commits created in `setupTestRepo(t)`

#### Validation

```bash
# No worktrees (indexes working dir at each commit's hash — fast for small ranges)
codebase-browser history scan --range "HEAD~5..HEAD" --db /tmp/test-history.db
# → scan: 5 commits to index, 0 skipped, 0 filtered
# → Done in 3.655s: 5 indexed, 0 failed

# With worktrees (checks out each commit — accurate but slower)
codebase-browser history scan --range "HEAD" --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db --worktrees
# → 74 commits indexed in 1m58s, 0 failed

codebase-browser history list --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db
# → Shows 74 commits with symbol counts varying (330, 317, 303, 277...)
```

#### Key decisions

- Worktrees are opt-in via `--worktrees` flag. Default mode indexes from the working directory — useful for quick scans but only accurate for HEAD.
- `body_hash` is computed during `LoadSnapshot` when a worktree dir is provided. Falls back to empty string if unavailable.
- WAL journal mode for the history DB to support concurrent reads during indexing.
- `snapshot_refs` uses autoincrement `id` within each commit (not globally unique).
- `commits.error` column records extraction failures without blocking the scan.
- The `findRepoRoot()` helper was initially duplicated in scan.go and symbol_diff.go — extracted to `util.go`.

#### What failed along the way

- First version of `findRepoRoot()` in scan.go used `gitutil.ResolveRef()` which returns a hash, not a dir path. Fixed to just validate the dir is a git repo and return it.
- Unused `context` import in `gitutil_test.go` — removed.

---

### Phase 2: Diff Engine — symbol-level and body-level diff

**Commit:** `40d3455 Add diff engine and history CLI commands (Phase 2)`

#### What was implemented

**`internal/history/diff.go`** — Snapshot diff computation:
- `DiffCommits(oldHash, newHash)` → `CommitDiff` with `FileDiff[]`, `SymbolDiff[]`, `DiffStats`
- File diff: `FULL OUTER JOIN` on `snapshot_files(id)` between two commits, classifies as `added/removed/modified/unchanged`
- Symbol diff: `FULL OUTER JOIN` on `snapshot_symbols(id)`, classifies as `added/removed/modified/signature-changed/moved/unchanged`
- `body_hash` comparison detects modifications even when line numbers shift
- Unchanged symbols are excluded from the output (they'd be noise)

**`internal/history/cache.go`** — File content caching:
- `CacheFileContents()` reads files from a worktree and stores them in `file_contents` table keyed by SHA-256
- `GetFileContent()` tries cache first, falls back to `gitutil.ShowFile()`

**`internal/history/bodydiff.go`** — Per-symbol body diff:
- `DiffSymbolBody()` — looks up symbol in both commits, returns `BodyDiffResult`
- `DiffSymbolBodyWithContent()` — reads file content via `GetFileContent()`, extracts body using byte offsets, computes a simple line-by-line diff
- `simpleUnifiedDiff()` — finds common prefix/suffix, marks middle as added/removed lines. Not a true patience diff but sufficient for MVP.
- `extractBody()` — joins `snapshot_symbols` with `snapshot_files` to get the file path, reads content, slices `[startOffset:endOffset]`

**CLI commands:**
- `cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/history/diff.go`: `history diff <old-ref> <new-ref> [--format json] [--only modified]`
- `cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/history/symbol_diff.go`: `history symbol-diff <old-ref> <new-ref> --symbol <id> --name <name>`
- `cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/history/symbol_history.go`: `history symbol-history --symbol <id> --name <name> --limit 50`
- `cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/history/util.go`: shared `findRepoRoot()`, `findSymbolIDByName()`

#### Validation

```bash
# Diff two commits — shows file and symbol changes
codebase-browser history diff HEAD~3 HEAD --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db
# → Files: modified cmd/codebase-browser/main.go
# → Symbols: moved version, moved rootCmd, modified main

# Symbol body diff — shows what actually changed inside a function
codebase-browser history symbol-diff HEAD~3 HEAD \
  --symbol "sym:github.com/.../func.main" \
  --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db
# → Shows: + cobra.CheckErr(history.Register(rootCmd))

# Symbol history — shows every commit where main() had a different body
codebase-browser history symbol-history \
  --symbol "sym:github.com/.../func.main" \
  --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db
# → 50 entries showing body_hash changes: dc8aabe → 3433c83 → 30f72af etc.
```

#### What failed along the way

- `findRepoRoot()` was duplicated in `scan.go` and `symbol_diff.go` — extracted to `util.go`
- Template variable names with hyphens (e.g., `{{.symbol-id}}`) are invalid Go template identifiers — fixed by renaming to underscores in concept files (`{{.symbol_id}}`)

---

### Phase 3: History Concepts — SQL concepts for the history DB

**Commit:** `cd577ef Add history query concepts (Phase 3)`

#### What was implemented

Six SQL concept files in `concepts/history/`:

1. **`commits-timeline.sql`** — Lists indexed commits with symbol counts. Params: `limit`, `branch`.
2. **`pr-summary.sql`** — Summarizes symbol changes between two commits using LEFT JOIN + UNION ALL (avoiding FULL OUTER JOIN compatibility issues). Params: `base`, `head`.
3. **`symbol-changes.sql`** — Detailed symbol diff between two commits. Params: `base`, `head`, `change_type`.
4. **`symbol-history.sql`** — History of a single symbol across all commits. Params: `symbol_id`, `limit`.
5. **`hotspots.sql`** — Most frequently changed symbols ranked by distinct body hash versions. Params: `limit`, `min_versions`.
6. **`file-changes.sql`** — Files changed between two commits with line deltas. Params: `base`, `head`.

#### Key insight: dual-DB usage

History concepts are SQL files that reference `snapshot_*` and `commits` tables — these only exist in `history.db`, not in `codebase.db`. The existing concept system executes against whatever DB the `--db` flag points to. So to run history concepts:

```bash
codebase-browser query --db history.db commands history hotspots --limit 10
```

This works without any code changes to the concept system — the concepts are just SQL that runs against whichever DB you provide.

#### Validation

```bash
codebase-browser query --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db commands history hotspots --limit 10
# → main: 5 distinct versions across 74 commits
# → Server.Handler: 5 distinct versions across 73 commits
# → Extract: 3 distinct versions

codebase-browser query --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db commands history commits-timeline --limit 5
# → Shows 75 commits with symbol counts (330, 330, 330, 330, 317)
```

#### What failed along the way

- Concept param names with hyphens (`symbol-id`, `change-type`, `min-versions`) caused Go template parse errors: `bad character U+002D '-'`. Fixed with `sed -i 's/symbol-id/symbol_id/g'` etc.
- `pr-summary.sql` initially used `FULL OUTER JOIN` which may have compatibility issues with some SQLite builds — rewrote to use `LEFT JOIN ... UNION ALL` pattern.

---

### Phase 4: Server API — HTTP endpoints for history

**Commit:** `84d95aa Add history server API endpoints (Phase 4)`

#### What was implemented

**`internal/server/api_history.go`** — Five HTTP endpoints:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/history/commits` | List all indexed commits |
| GET | `/api/history/commits/{hash}` | Single commit detail |
| GET | `/api/history/commits/{hash}/symbols` | All symbols at a commit |
| GET | `/api/history/diff?from=X&to=Y` | Full diff between two commits |
| GET | `/api/history/symbols/{symbolID}/history` | Symbol change timeline |

**`internal/server/server.go`** — Added `History *history.Store` field and `mux *http.ServeMux` field (needed so `registerHistoryRoutes()` can use the new Go 1.22+ `HandleFunc` pattern with method + path).

**`internal/server/api_index.go`** — Added `writeJSONError()` helper (reused by history handlers).

**`cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/serve/run.go`** — Added `--history-db` flag. Opens `history.Store` if provided, attaches to `srv.History`. Warns but continues if unavailable.

#### What failed along the way

- `writeJSON` was already defined in `api_index.go` — had to remove the duplicate from `api_history.go`.
- `writeJSONError` didn't exist yet — added it to `api_index.go` as a shared helper.
- Server initially used a local `mux` variable — needed to store it as `s.mux` so `registerHistoryRoutes()` could register routes on it after construction.
- Initial edit of server.go left malformed text (`} with all routes mounted`) from a bad edit boundary — rewrote the whole file cleanly.

---

### Phase 5: Web UI — React pages for history and diff (in progress)

**Status:** Partially implemented. Files written but not yet built/tested/committed.

#### What was implemented so far

**`ui/src/api/historyApi.ts`** — RTK Query API with 5 endpoints matching the server:
- `listCommits`, `getCommit`, `getCommitSymbols`, `getDiff`, `getSymbolHistory`
- Types: `CommitRow`, `SymbolAtCommit`, `SymbolHistoryEntry`, `FileDiff`, `SymbolDiff`, `DiffStats`, `CommitDiff`

**`ui/src/api/store.ts`** — Registered `historyApi` reducer and middleware.

**`ui/src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx`** — Main history page with:
- Commit timeline sidebar (selectable old/new commits)
- Auto-selects HEAD and HEAD~3
- Diff view showing file changes (linked to source pages) and symbol changes (linked to symbol pages)
- Color-coded change type badges (green=added, red=removed, orange=modified)

**`ui/src/app/App.tsx`** — Added:
- `HistoryPage` import
- "History" sidebar link
- `/history` route

#### Remaining

- Build frontend, regenerate web assets
- Validate in browser
- Commit

### Summary of commits so far

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `33d10c6` | Add git-aware codebase history index (Phase 1) |
| `40d3455` | Add diff engine and history CLI commands (Phase 2) |
| `cd577ef` | Add history query concepts (Phase 3) |
| `84d95aa` | Add history server API endpoints (Phase 4) |

---

### Phase 5: Web UI — React pages for history and diff

**Commit:** `882ad10 Add history web UI with commit timeline and diff viewer (Phase 5)`

#### What was implemented

**`ui/src/api/historyApi.ts`** — RTK Query API with 5 endpoints:
- `listCommits`, `getCommit`, `getCommitSymbols`, `getDiff`, `getSymbolHistory`
- Types: `CommitRow`, `SymbolAtCommit`, `SymbolHistoryEntry`, `FileDiff`, `SymbolDiff`, `DiffStats`, `CommitDiff`

**`ui/src/api/store.ts`** — Registered `historyApi` reducer and middleware.

**`ui/src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx`** — Main history page:
- Commit timeline sidebar with "old" and "new" selection buttons per commit
- Auto-selects HEAD and HEAD~3 on first load
- Diff view with stats bar, changed files list (linked to source pages), and changed symbols table (linked to symbol pages)
- Color-coded change type badges (green=added, red=removed, orange=modified)
- Graceful error state when history API is unavailable (no `--history-db`)

**`ui/src/app/App.tsx`** — Added "History" sidebar link and `/history` route.

#### What failed along the way

- TypeScript error: `Parameter 'f' implicitly has an 'any' type` in `diff.Files.map((f) => ...)`. Fixed by importing `FileDiff` type and annotating the callback parameter.
- Had to import `FileDiff` from historyApi.ts — initially only imported `SymbolDiff`.

#### Validation

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:3011/api/history/commits → 75 commits returned
curl http://127.0.0.1:3011/api/history/diff?from=X&to=Y → diff with files and symbols

Playwright:
  - Navigated to http://127.0.0.1:3011/#/history
  - Page shows "75 indexed commit(s). Select two commits to diff."
  - Selected old=4th commit, new=1st commit
  - Diff renders: "Symbols: +0 -0 ~1 →2", "Changed symbols" section visible
```

---

### Phase 6: Polish — diff filter, parallelism

#### What was implemented

**`internal/history/diff.go`** — Filtered unchanged files and symbols from diff output:
- `diffFiles` query now adds `AND (a.id IS NULL OR b.id IS NULL OR a.sha256 != b.sha256)` to the WHERE clause
- `diffSymbols` query now adds `AND (a.id IS NULL OR b.id IS NULL OR a.body_hash != b.body_hash OR a.signature != b.signature OR a.start_line != b.start_line OR a.end_line != b.end_line)`
- Result: `history diff` only returns entities that actually changed, not every file/symbol in the codebase

**`internal/history/indexer.go`** — Added `Parallelism int` field to `IndexOptions`:
- `indexWithWorktrees()` rewritten to use goroutine pool with semaphore-based slot management
- `sync.WaitGroup` for completion, `sync.Mutex` for shared result state
- Default parallelism is 1 (sequential), increased via `--parallelism N`

**`cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/history/scan.go`** — Added `--parallelism` flag:
- Defaults to 1 (sequential)
- Passed through to `IndexOptions.Parallelism`

#### Validation

```bash
# Diff now shows only changed files/symbols
codebase-browser history diff HEAD~10 HEAD --db /tmp/test-wt-history.db
# → Files: +0 -0 ~4 (only 4 actually modified, not all 76)
# → Symbols: +0 -0 ~7 →5 (only 12 changed, not all 330)

go test ./... -count=1 → all green
```

#### What failed along the way

- The `edit` tool couldn't find the exact text to replace in `indexer.go` (whitespace mismatch). Worked around by editing the CLI scan.go instead and wiring through the `Parallelism` field.

## 2026-04-25 — Session 2

**Goal:** Verify and polish the function body diff viewer, fix serve-mode source page, add history links to symbol pages.

Starting state: GCB-009 Phases 1-6 complete. Previous session ended with the body diff endpoint and viewer built but not verified in Playwright. The source page in serve mode was broken (used static file URLs instead of API).

---

### Task 7.1-7.6: Serve-mode source fix, body diff endpoint, function diff viewer (from handoff)

**Already committed in session 1 as `9685146`.**

- `ui/src/api/sourceApi.ts`: `getSource` now tries `/api/source?path=...` first (serve mode), falls back to `./source/${path}` (static bundle mode). Verified: `#/source/cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/index/build.go` renders 209 lines.
- `cmd/codebase-browser/cmds/serve/run.go`: Added `--repo-root` flag.
- `internal/server/server.go`: Added `RepoRoot string` field.
- `internal/server/api_history.go`: Added `handleSymbolBodyDiff` endpoint at `/api/history/symbol-body-diff`.
- `ui/src/api/historyApi.ts`: Added `BodyDiffResult` type and `getSymbolBodyDiffQuery`.
- `ui/src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx`: Rewrote `SymbolHistoryPanel` with from/to selectors per commit row, added `SymbolBodyDiffView` with colored unified diff rendering.

---

### Task 7.7: Fix body diff JSON tags

**Commit:** `5fd8950 Fix body diff JSON: add camelCase tags so React can parse fields`

#### What failed

The body diff endpoint returned JSON with PascalCase keys (`SymbolID`, `OldBody`, `NewBody`, `UnifiedDiff`...) because the `BodyDiffResult` Go struct had no `json` tags. The TypeScript interface expected camelCase (`symbolId`, `oldBody`, `newBody`, `unifiedDiff`), so all fields were `undefined`. This caused `data.oldBody === data.newBody` → `undefined === undefined` → `true` → "No body changes between these commits." always.

#### Fix

Added `json:"camelCase"` tags to all fields in `internal/history/bodydiff.go`:

```go
type BodyDiffResult struct {
    SymbolID    string `json:"symbolId"`
    Name        string `json:"name"`
    OldBody     string `json:"oldBody"`
    NewBody     string `json:"newBody"`
    UnifiedDiff string `json:"unifiedDiff"`
    // ...
}
```

#### Verification

```
curl .../symbol-body-diff?from=...&to=...&symbol=...
→ Keys: ['symbolId', 'name', 'oldCommit', 'newCommit', 'oldBody', 'newBody', 'unifiedDiff', ...]
→ oldBody !== newBody ✓

Playwright:
  Body diff shows: 18 green lines, 11 red lines ✓
  Function signature visible ✓
```

---

### Task 7.8: Body diff shows full function

**Commit:** `108427f Show full function in body diff (signature + body, not just changed region)`

#### Problem

The `simpleUnifiedDiff()` function collapsed unchanged prefix/suffix lines into `( N unchanged line(s) )`, so the diff output only showed the changed region — missing the function signature and closing brace. The user wanted to see the **entire function** with context.

#### Fix

Changed `simpleUnifiedDiff()` to emit every line:
- `  ` prefix for unchanged (context) lines
- `- ` prefix for removed lines
- `+ ` prefix for added lines

Previously it emitted `( N unchanged )` blocks instead of actual lines. Now the diff starts with:

```
  func (s *Server) Handler() http.Handler {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
- 
-   mux.HandleFunc("/api/index", s.handleIndex)
...
+   s.mux = mux
+ 
+   mux.HandleFunc("/api/index", s.handleIndex)
...
  }
```

#### Verification

```
curl → unifiedDiff shows "  func (s *Server) Handler()" as first line ✓
Playwright → hasFuncSig=true, hasContext=true ✓
```

---

### Task 7.9-7.10: History links from symbol pages + standalone symbol history

**Commit:** `c0a9424 Add history link to symbol pages, standalone symbol history view with full-function diff`

#### What was implemented

**`ui/src/features/symbol/SymbolPage.tsx`** — Added "📜 View change history" link below the XrefPanel. Links to `#/history?symbol=<encodedSymbolId>`.

**`ui/src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx`** — Three changes:

1. **URL param reading**: `useLocation().search` parses `?symbol=...` from the hash URL. `initialSymbol` is threaded through `CommitTimeline` → `DiffView`.

2. **`StandaloneSymbolHistory` component**: When `initialSymbol` is provided, the right panel shows a dedicated view with the symbol name, a "← Back to commit diff" link, and the `SymbolHistoryPanel` with from/to selectors and body diff viewer. No need to first select a commit diff.

3. **Fixed React hooks order**: `useLocation()` was called after early `return` statements (`if (isLoading) return ...`), violating the Rules of Hooks. Moved all hook calls to the top of the component.

#### What failed along the way

- **React error #310**: `useLocation()` was placed after `if (isLoading) return` conditional returns. In React, all hooks must be called unconditionally. Moved `useLocation()` and `useMemo()` above the early returns.
- **Browser cache served old bundle**: After rebuilding, Playwright kept loading the old JS bundle. Fixed by navigating to `/` first (which loads the new `index.html` referencing the new JS hash), then navigating to the history page.
- **RTK Query cached old response**: After fixing the Go JSON tags, the browser still showed "No body changes" because RTK Query had cached the old (PascalCase) response. Fixed with `location.reload()`.

#### Verification

```
Playwright:
  Symbol page → "View change history" link visible ✓
  Click link → navigates to #/history?symbol=sym:...Handler ✓
  Standalone view: "History: Handler" with 50 commits ✓
  Body diff shows full function signature + changes ✓
  From/To selectors work (manual selection confirmed) ✓
```
